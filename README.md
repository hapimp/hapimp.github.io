# The **Mini MiSTer Arcade** Resource Page
I am gathering all the stuff I can find about the best way to use an iPad 3/4 display in a mini arcade machine, like the iCade.

This page will offer recommendations on what to buy and how to build a mini arcade machine using [MiSTer hardware](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) and an iPad 3/4 screen.

This machine is a really nice and low lag solution for retro gaming, with some drawbacks.

This is how my arcade currently looks.

### What to buy
To make a MiSTer Mini Arcade you will need an arcade cabinet, a MiSTer, a display, and various bits and pieces to put it all together.

- **MiSTer**: Follow the instructions over on the MiSTer wiki [MiSTer wiki](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) to figure out what you need.
- **Joystick**: I chose to replace the joystick in the arcade cabinet with Sanwa parts. OBSF-30 buttons (8) and the JLF-8YT-SK joystick.
- You will also need a controller board if you buy arcade joystick and buttons. I chose an [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) (you can get clones way cheaper than this, but this one is really good) with the [DaemonBite firmware](https://github.com/MickGyver/DaemonBite-Arcade-Encoder) (a really low lag solution, and not expensive at all).
